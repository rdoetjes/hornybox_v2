- This is the second iteration of a little Gimmick that I created back in 2009, called the Horny Box.<br />
- This time it honks when it detects a face (making it operate autonimously)<br />
- But like the previous iteraction you can also honk it from a remote control. However the 433MHz remote is replaced by your mobile phone.<br />
- The HornyBox will advertise itself as an Access Point (AP) and it will present a basic web pages that allows you to trigger the horn and/or activate/deactivate the face detection.<br />
- And you can view the captured images taken by the HornyBox, every time the horn was sounded.
